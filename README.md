# Alethic Instruction-Based State Machine (ISM) Core SDK for Golang
The Alethic ISM Core SDK is the foundational layer of the Alethic ISM project group. It provides the core processor and state management functionalities required to build specialized processors—including language-based processors—and to handle the majority of state input/output processing.

### Key Concepts
 * State Information: Handles state data for specific processing configurations. 
 * State Management: Maintains coherence in state columns and rows. 
 * Routing Management: Manages the NATS routing table and facilitates data subscription and transmission. 
 * ISM Data Model: Implements a subset of the ISM data model with some components still under development.

### Status 
This project is actively under development and remains in an experimental/prototype phase. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the project evolves.
